# SteamCommunityWorkshopCollectionScrubber

INFO: Community Collection Scrubber designed for hosting zomboid servers that require modid and workshopid
Designed only for ZOMBOID at the moment.

This is a work in progress. So, if you encounter any bugs or problems please open a detailed issue with pictures so I can solve it.

Setup Guide:
1: Click green Code dropdown box <br>
2: Download ZIP
3: Unzip folder into whatever folder you want
4: Open communityScrubber
5: Run communityScrubber.exe
6: Enter URL for community collection for zomboid
7: Click start and await results

Current function:
1: Takes steam community URL for zomboid and outputs the MODID and WORKSHOPID into a file.
2: If the MODID or WORKSHOPID is formatted incorectly or does not exist that mod will not be added to the file.
3: Once complete two files will be created in the root folder of communityScrubber, where the .exe file is located.
4: These two files (modId.txt & workshopId.txt) will contain the modid and workshopid's of the mods from the community collection.
